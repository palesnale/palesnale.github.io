Hi there! Welcome to my website. I am currently getting my Master's degree in computer science at UCLA. Here you can see what I've been up to. :moyai:

## Projects

### Last of Sus
Worked with a team of 4 to create an artificial life simulation recreating a zombie apocalypse scenario using Unity. Simulation included three types of entities that interacted with each other: zombies, humans, and fungi. In C#, the simulation involved the writing of life simulation techniques including boiding, A\* pathfinding, L systems, and behavior trees.

### CNN for ASL Recognition
Using Python TensorFlow's high level API, I wrote a convolutional neural network that could identify the letter an American Sign Language hand gesture represented. This was done within a Python notebook to make it easier to interact with data. 

### myCurl
A Python project that recreates the functionality of the "curl" command available on Linux systems for HTTP pages. Connections were set up more manually using the Python sockets library.

## Experience
- AI Intern - Verisilicon - Jun 2023 to Sep 2023
  - Contributed to the development of the company's traditional image enhancement project, allowing it to generate more detailed images with less oversharpening.
  - Explored machine learning based alternatives, such as super resolution neural networks including ESPCNs and FSRCNNs implemented using Python TensorFlow, which were able to get better results in comparison to the traditional approach.
  - Also worked on a Python project that connects to ChatGPT through OpenAI's API to upload and analyze neural networks stored as JSON files.
  - The Python Langchain library was used to upload files and text requests through OpenAI for ChatGPT's analysis.
- Software Engineer Internship - Adaptrum - Sep 2021 to Sep 2022
  - Developed communication features to improve user convenience when they interact with the product pages which were for embedded devices running on OpenWrt, a Linux operating system.
  - Highlights include the creation of a new update feature which allowed devices to download updates directly from a remote source, replacing the old method which involved the user getting the update files first and then uploading it themselves to the device.
  - Features were written in HTML/CSS and Lua.
- Apprenticeship - Smart Energy Analytic Disaggregation Systems (SEADS) - University of California, Santa Cruz - Dec 2020 to Sep 2021
  - Worked with a team of 5 to do frontend work on a website created with JavaScript React to display power measurements from remote devices in a user-friendly way.
  - Rewrote React codebase to use its more modern features, such as functional components.
  - Used SQL to interact with a PostgreSQL database to retrieve backend data.

## Education
